## About NextJS
- https://nextjs.org/docs
- Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.
- It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly.

## Types of typescript file extensions

- .ts
  
This is the standard file extension for TypeScript source code. These files contain TypeScript logic, including type annotations, interfaces, classes, and executable code. They are compiled into .js (JavaScript) files by the TypeScript compiler (tsc).

- .tsx
  
This extension is used for TypeScript files that contain JSX (JavaScript XML), commonly found in React applications. The .tsx extension signals to the TypeScript compiler that the file includes JSX syntax alongside TypeScript code, enabling proper parsing and type-checking of both.

- Additionally, there is a third type of file extension in TypeScript:
.d.ts: These are TypeScript declaration files. They contain only type information and do not produce executable JavaScript output. They are used to provide type definitions for JavaScript libraries or modules, allowing TypeScript projects to leverage type safety and tooling features even when interacting with JavaScript code.
